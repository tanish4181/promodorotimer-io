                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that creator Francesco Cirillo used. The technique aims to improve focus and reduce mental fatigue by encouraging you to work with the time you have, rather than against it.</p>
